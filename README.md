1. Go to https://app.supabase.com and create a new project.
2. Go to Table Editor and create a table called todos with these fields:

| Field     | Type    | Description                  |
|-----------|---------|------------------------------|
| id        | UUID    | Primary key, auto-generated  |
| title     | Text    | Task title                   |
| done      | Boolean | Whether the task is done     |
| deleted   | Boolean | Soft-delete flag             |
| user_id   | UUID    | References `auth.users`      |

3. Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on ```todos``` and add this policy:
```bash

ON todos
FOR ALL
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```
